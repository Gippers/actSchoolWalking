# ACT School Walking Analysis

As part of Govhack 2025, the Australian Captial Territory (ACT) set the following challenge:

> How can we leverage graph analytics, generative AI and other data approaches to optimise public school transport networks to make it simple to get the next generation of students to school with less hassle?

An imporant, and potentially under appreciated aspect of travelling to school is walking. In 2018 in the ACT approximately 40 per cent of children were reported to usually walk or cylce to school [Healthy Schools ACT](https://www.healthyschoolsact.com.au/our-priorities/physical-activity). Walking to school helps children stay physically active, reduces traffic and helps to reduce our carbon footprint [NSW Education](https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/road-safety-education/safe-travel/walking). 

A key consideration in children being able to walk to school is the distance that they need to travel. If local communities in the ACT don't have a local primary or high school, then children won't have the same opportunity to walk to school. This is particulary important if as the ACT matures and families start to live in different parts of Canberra, the school system does not adapt to these shifting demands.

## Questions
- How has the geographic distribution of school aged children changed since 2001?
- How long would it take on average for school aged children in the ACT to walk to their nearest ACT public primary or high school?
- If a new primary or high school were built today, where would be the optimal place to build it to reduce the distance
