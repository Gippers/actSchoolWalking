In reality, schools will have a fixed numer of students that they can teach. Future analyis could account for this, and it may result in resonably different findings particularily about where the optimal school placement is. - Some outer suburbs in Canberra were removed because of their small populations."

The few key things worth noting are that in 2001 there were a lot of young familes in south Canberra. In 2004, there are still a large number however, there has been a considerable decline. Instead, many more families have moved to the newer Canberra suburbs such as greater Gungahlin and Coombs/Wright area. Overall there has been an increase of school aged children since 2001."
