# actSchoolWalk

We all grew up hearing stories of the mountains our parents climbed on their daily trips to school. This raises the question, how long does it actuall take the average primary and high-school aged child in Canberra to walk to school? Have their been any noticable changes over time? 

How long does it take school children in the Australian Capital territory to walk to school?
